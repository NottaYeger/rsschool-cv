## **About Me:**

I am currently studying front-end programming, where I am dedicated to honing my skills and staying updated with the latest trends and technologies. With strong interpersonal skills, I thrive in team environments and effectively collaborate with others to achieve common goals. I am detail-oriented, possess a good understanding of user experience design, and have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My adaptability and eagerness to learn enable me to tackle challenges creatively and contribute positively to any project.

## **Code example:**

Some time ago I was working on a project “Rock-Paper-Scissors”. It was a front-end course project, but I’d spent a great deal of time to make improvements to it concerning both design and functionality.
```
function pickComputerMove() {
  const randomNumber = Math.random();
  let computerMove = '';

  if (randomNumber >= 0 && randomNumber < 1 / 3) {
    computerMove = 'rock';
  } else if (randomNumber >= 1 / 3 && randomNumber < 2 / 3) {
    computerMove = 'paper';
  } else {
    computerMove = 'scissors';
  }

  return computerMove;
}
```
